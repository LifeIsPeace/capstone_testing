# Concept Notes

## Broad Coneceptual notes

- I'm going to use semi-supervised learning. THis allows me to use datasets without overfitting to a certain instrument.
- Maestro dataset as foundation.
- It's an AI music transcription system. Or like an AI music transcriber

### Dataset Notes

- Use a midifile as the label rather than explicit note names like "A1", "A2"
- All datasets must be converted to the same label format. Maestro defines label semantics
