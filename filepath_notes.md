Pure Path Useless lol. Unless you're dealing with multiple os's in some way.
</b>Concrete Paths are the way to go

# Maestro dataset in drive
```
- MIDI-Unprocessed_Chamber2_MID--AUDIO_09_R3_2018_wav--1
- MIDI-Unprocessed_Chamber2_MID--AUDIO_09_R3_2018_wav--1

- MIDI-Unprocessed_Chamber3_MID--AUDIO_10_R3_2018_wav--1
- MIDI-Unprocessed_Chamber3_MID--AUDIO_10_R3_2018_wav--1
```

- In the drive, every associated midi and wav file have the same name. All that needs to change
is the file extention.
- In the future, iterate through the folders with training data (2004,2006, etc) by reading if the file begins with a digit
Make sure to store if you have already iterated through it.
